# Battle Bottles -  Initial documentation

## Project description
_Battle Bottles_ is a Flutter application inspired by the classic battleships game, where players take command of miniature crews navigating tiny bottles across dynamic battlefields. Players can compete against the computer or challenge friends in multiplayer mode. I'm hoping to offer some rules changes according to the chosen difficulty level of the game.

## Optional requirements
- Level/story mode allowing the player to progress and reveal new challenges and obstacles, making the game surprising and dynamic.
- Adding a strategic aspect to the story mode of the game, when you have to choose how many "ships" to send into battle, which can have consequences affecting future games.
- New rules, obstacles and power-ups.
- Tracking statistics including wins, losses, and other gameplay metrics.
- Money and shopping system.
- Support for web or desktop.

## User stories
