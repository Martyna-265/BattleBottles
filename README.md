# Battle Bottles
---
_Battle Bottles_ is a Flutter application made for the Flutter course during the fifth semester (2025/2026) at the Warsaw University of Technology.  
It's inspired by the classic battleships game. You can check out the web version [here](https://battlebottles-d5aee.web.app/).
Take command of miniature crews navigating tiny bottles across dynamic battlefields. The seas may be small, but the strategy runs deep as you outmaneuver opponents in a test of wits and luck. Will your fleet survive the storm, or will your hopes end up shattered at the bottom of the ocean?
## How to play
---
1.  **Setup the Board:** Choose your fleet size and the dimensions of the battlefield grid. Remember, fair play is key - your opponent will face the exact same conditions.
2.  **Deploy Your Fleet:** Drag and drop your ships to strategic positions. You can tap on a ship to rotate it or change its formation. Press **Start** when you are ready to lock in your strategy.
3.  **Open Fire:** Tap on the enemy grid to launch a bomb. If you score a direct hit, you are rewarded with a bonus shot. The same rule applies to your opponent!
4.  **Special Tactics:** Before firing, you can activate a **Power-up** to turn the tide of battle. Use them wisely, as your supply is limited. _Note: In single-player, the computer does not use power-ups, but it has the ability to randomly strike twice in a single round._
5.  **Track Progress:** Keep an eye on the ship counter below the enemy grid. To win, you must sink every ship type in their fleet.
6.  **After Action Report:** Even if you lose, you can reveal the battlefield to see the enemy's formation and discover exactly where those elusive ships were hiding.
## Power-ups
---
- **Octopus:** Unleash the beast! Select a square, and the Octopus will drag down 4 random points surrounding that target.
- **Triple Shot:** Fire three times in a single round. If you hit a ship, the standard bonus rules apply, allowing for devastating combos.
- **Shark:** High risk, high reward. Select a row on the enemy grid to sink it entirely. But beware - the Shark bites back, destroying the corresponding line on **your own** grid as well!
## Multiplayer
